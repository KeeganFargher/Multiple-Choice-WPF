# Multiple Choice Test System

A multiple choice test system where lectures can create tests and students can answer the tests. Lectures can generate a marks report
students can view the memo to the test.

## Getting Started
The database was built using MsSQL. To get the database up and running, [Run this SQL query on your database](https://pastebin.com/5mk4Dwth)
and change the location of the database in your app.config file.

After you have cloned the project, you may need to tell Visual Studio that the library is not a windows application
by right clicking ->  

**MultipleChoiceLibrary -> Properties -> Output Type -> Class Library.**  
  
Do the same for MultipleChoiceUI, but setting the output type to Windows Application.

## Built With
* .NET Framework
* Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
* MsSQL
